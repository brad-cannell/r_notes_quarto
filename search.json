A lot of this will be about ggplot.\nPresenting results: Notes about making numerical and graphical summaries accessible outside of R. This can include webpages, static dashboards, PDF documents, Microsoft Office documents, etc. This does not include Shiny apps.\nCollaboration: Notes about collaborative coding.

See Chapter 2 for notes about regular expressions in general.\n\n1.1.1.1 Substituions\nI was working on making updates to Intro to R. While converting Rmd documents to Qmd documents, I was looking for a way to use the find and replace tool to convert the code chunk options from their knitr style (i.e., {eval=FALSE}) to the Quarto style (i.e., #| eval: false). Using this SO post, I did some experimenting in regex101 and found a solution. Here it is:\nFind code (with leading space): eval=FALSE}\nReplace code: }\\n#| eval: false\\n\nIt turns out that the substitution part is pretty straightforward in this case, but I think that stack overflow post will be useful for more complicated cases when I have to use capture groups as well.",

As explained in there, the code to create and/or clean the data will go in the data-raw directory and the data will eventually go in the data/ directory.\nFor the codebook package, I wanted to simulate some really simple data that could be used for package examples. Here’s how I did it.\nI started by running usethis::use_data_raw(\"study\"). Among other things, this creates the R script to be used to simulate the study data. Here is the header for the study data.\n\n# =============================================================================\n# Study data\n# This is the code to create the study data - a simulated data set that can be\n# used to demonstrate how to use the codebook package.\n# Created: 2022-04-04\n# Brad Cannell\n# =============================================================================\n\n# Insert simulation code here...\n\n\n# Add the simulated data to the data directory.\nusethis::use_data(study, overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n\n4.12.7 Documenting data\n\nObjects in data/ are always effectively exported (they use a slightly different mechanism than NAMESPACE but the details are not important). This means that they must be documented. Documenting data is like documenting a function with a few minor differences. Instead of documenting the data directly, you document the name of the dataset and save it in R/.1\n\nFor example, the roxygen2 block used to document the study data in the codebook package is saved as R/data.R and looks something like this:\n\n#' Simulated study data.\n#'\n#' This is the code to create the study data - a simulated data set that can be\n#' used to demonstrate how to use the codebook package.\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with 20 rows and 4 variables:\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{id}{participant id}\n#'   \\item{gender}{participant gender, female/male}\n#'   \\item{date}{date of enrollment}\n#'   \\item{height}{participant height, in inches}\n#' }\n\"study\"\n\n\n“@format gives an overview of the dataset. For data frames, you should include a definition list that describes each variable. It’s usually a good idea to describe variables’ units here.”1\n“Neverexport? a data set.”1\nThe file is save as R/data.R.\n\nClick here to view the documentation for ggplot’s diamonds data.\n\n\n4.12.8 Documenting Package\nYou can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. As described in section 10.6 of R Packages,1\n\nYou can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. This is accessed with package?foo, and can be used to describe the most important components of your package. It’s a useful supplement to vignettes, as described in the next chapter.\n\n\nThere’s no object that corresponds to a package, so you need to document NULL, and then manually label it with @docType package and @name &lt;package-name&gt;. This is also an excellent place to use the @section tag to divide up page into useful categories.\n\n\nI usually put this documentation in a file called &lt;package-name&gt;.R. It’s also a good place to put the package level import statements that you’ll learn about in imports.\n\n\n#' foo: A package for computating the notorious bar statistic\n#'\n#' The foo package provides three categories of important functions:\n#' foo, bar and baz.\n#' \n#' @section Foo functions:\n#' The foo functions ...\n#'\n#' @docType package\n#' @name foo\nNULL",

However, devtools::install_github() (and friends) will not build vignettes by default because they’re time consuming and may require additional packages. So, in order to be able to view the vignette in RStudio, you must use vignettes = TRUE, e.g., devtools::install_github(“brad-cannell/bfuncs”, build_vignettes = TRUE) instead.\nUse devtools::build_vignettes() to create an html version of the vignette in inst/doc that you can provide a link to on your Github README page. By default, these folders will be added to .gitignore. Remove them from .gitignore to be able to view/use them on Github. Create a rawgit version of the html vignette file, and providea link to it on README.\nuse use devtools::build() to create a package bundle with the vignettes included. RStudio’s “Build & reload” does not build vignettes to save time.\nWhen you add or update vignettes, push to Github again.\n\n\n\n4.14.2 Vignette Notes:\nThis builds the vignettes, and is probably fine for a regular package of functions. However, when using packages as a means for reproducible, self-contained analysis projects, the vignettes have greater importance, and by default are not easily accessible.\nNeed to find a way to make the vignettes more “front and center”\n\nCreate a help page for the entire package that includes links to the vignettes?\nInclude links to the README.md file and upload to GitHub (with the data sets excluded)?\nRemember to use system.file() when reading in data inside a code chunk. If you have trouble getting it to work, try build & reload.\nTo save a data frame to data/ inside a vignette, you can use the rprojroot package. use rprojroot::find_root(\"DESCRIPTION\")\n\n\n\n4.14.3 Pkgdown\nI haven’t tried the pkgdown package yet, but I think it is essentially a collection supercharged vignettes for your package.
