This repository is primarily intended to be helpful to me, but even better if you find it useful too! This version of my R Notes replaces the previous Bookdown version.\nWhy am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)?",

A lot of this will be about ggplot.\nPresenting results: Notes about making numerical and graphical summaries accessible outside of R.

This is primarily notes on using Git and GitHub.\nShiny: I am no longer keeping notes about Shiny here.
