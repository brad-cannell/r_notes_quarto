# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Brad Cannell's R Notes!

This repository is for a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version Brad Cannell's R Notes. This repository is primarily intended to be helpful to me, but even better if you find it useful too! This version of my R Notes replaces the previous [Bookdown version](https://brad-cannell.github.io/r_notes/). 

Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)?       

- Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search).      

- Easy access -- just click on the bookmark on web browser.      

- Practice using Quarto.      

- Might help with R4Epi -- This can be sort of a sandbox for developing before I add things to R4Epi.   

## Organization {-}

These notes are loosely organized into the following parts:   

- **Programming:** Notes about optimizing code, writing functions, creating packages, and repeated operations.   

- **Data Simulation:** Notes about simulating data.

- **Working with external files:** Notes about things like data transfer, web scraping, PDF scraping, and using Officer to scrape Microsoft Office documents.   

- **Data management:** Notes about manipulating/transforming/filtering data that is already in R.   

- **Analysis:** Notes about creating numerical summaries of data.

- **Data visualization:** Notes about graphical summaries of data. A lot of this will be about ggplot. 

- **Presenting results:**  Notes about making numerical and graphical summaries accessible outside of R. This can include webpages, static dashboards, PDF documents, Microsoft Office documents, etc. This does not include Shiny apps.  

- **Collaboration:**  Notes about collaborative coding. This is primarily notes on using Git and GitHub.  

- **Shiny:** I am no longer keeping notes about Shiny here. Shiny has it's own notebook. https://brad-cannell.github.io/shiny_notes_quarto/
