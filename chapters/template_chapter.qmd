# Chapter Template {#sec-template-chapter}

Try to make the chapter name and section name match.

Put the .qmd file and any other assets inside the same folder within the `chapters` folder.

Eventually, we might want to turn this into a formal [Quarto template](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/starter-templates.html).
