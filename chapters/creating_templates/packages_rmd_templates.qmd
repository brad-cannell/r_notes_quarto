# Creating Templates {#sec-creating-templates}

## Overview

The original version of this file contained notes about creating Rmd templates only. For now, that will still be the case. However, I renamed it generically as "Creating Templates" with the hopes that I would eventually add notes on creating other kinds of template files as well. 

## Rmd Templates

This section contains notes on creating Rmd templates for RStudio. 

ðŸ”´ Left off here...

1. In RStudio, click on the "new file" button.   
2. Click "R Markdown..."   

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/packages_rmd_templates/new_rmd.png")
```

3. Click "From Template" in the left sidebar menu.   
4. A list of Rmd templates appears in the "Template:" list.   

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/packages_rmd_templates/list_of_rmd_templates.png")
```

You can create your own templates and add them to this menu, which can be really handy! Below, I describe how to do that. 

**Important:** Rmd templates can only be added to RStudio's template list by adding the Rmd template to a package and then installing that package on your computer. Read Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) for an overview of creating R packages.

## Create a package

See [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) and/or [my R packages notes](#my-package-notes). 


## Add a template to your package

**Step 1.** Create directory for template

> Templates are located within the `inst/rmarkdown/templates` directory of a package. This structure can be generated automatically with the `use_rmarkdown_template()` function from the `usethis` package. It is possible to contain multiple templates in a single package, with each template stored in a separate sub-directory.

**Step 2.** 

For example, the "No Output" Rmd template can be viewed at: https://github.com/brad-cannell/templates/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/no_output/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd   

**Step 3.**  Change the name of the folder in `inst/rmarkdown/templates` from `template-name`. For example, `no_output`.

**Step 4.**  Open the folder you just renamed and update `template.yaml`. 

* The value you pass to the `name:` parameter will determine how the template is listed in RStudio's template list. For example, `name: No Output`.

* The value you pass to the `description:` parameter appear as a tool tip when you hover your mouse over the template's name in RStudio's template list. For, example, `Brad Cannell's template for an Rmd file with no output.`

**Step 5.** Create (or copy and paste) your Rmd template file into `skeleton/skeleton.Rmd`.

<p class="note"> ðŸ—’**Side Note:** If you already have a template in your package, you can create another one by pasting `usethis::use_rmarkdown_template()` in the console again and following the steps above. </p>
