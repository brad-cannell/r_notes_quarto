I'm going to walk through the process I used to create the `codebook` package, plus add some extra notes that have been helpful along the way when creating other packages. \n\nThis is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to creating packages. [Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) already exists for that purpose. This is supposed to just be a quick overview and some notes to remember in the future. \n\n\n## üåé Useful websites\n\n* [Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/)   \n* [devtools package](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools)   \n* [usethis package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)\n\n\n## Quick Process \n\n1. [Create new project/package directory](#create) with `usethis::create_package()`. Restart.\n\n2. [Add a NOTES file](#notes).\n\n3. [Add license](#license) with `usethis::use_mit_license()`.\n\n4. [Modify the description file](#modify).\n\n5. [Add README](#readme) with `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` and `devtools::build_readme()`.\n\n6. [Add Git](#git) with `usethis::use_git()`. Restart.\n\n7. [Connect to GitHub](#github) with `usethis::use_github()`.\n\n8. [Add functions to the package](#package-functions).\n\n9. [Creating unit tests](#testing).\n\n10. [Creating vignettes](#vignettes).\n\n11. [Completing a version of the package and (optionally) submitting to CRAN](#cran).\n\n\n## Before creating the package\n\nGive the package a new ([Hadley's naming strategies](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html))\n\n\n## Step 1: Create the package project {#create}\n\nCall `create_package()` to initialize a new package in a directory on your computer (and create the directory, if necessary).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::create_package(\"/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/R/Packages/codebook\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe function will do all of this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](create_package.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Add a NOTES file {#notes}\n\nThe [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) doesn't mention creating a `NOTES` file, but it's something I like to do. I use the notes file to help me remember little things related to the development of the package that aren't meant to be shared publicly. \n\n1. Create a new text file, add the following template to the top of the file, and fill it out appropriately. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# =============================================================================\n# codebook notes\n# =============================================================================\n\nUse NOTES for notes, but not tasks. Why or how, but not what.\n\n...\n\n\nSubmission Notes:\n-----------------\n* Useful website: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html\n* Update README before submission. It should roughly match the examples in the roxygen documentation.\n  - Update README.Rmd, not README.md.\n  - Knit README.Rmd after making changes. This will automatically update README.md\n* Update vignettes using devtools::document()\n* Update news.md. Here's dplyr's (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dplyr/master/NEWS.md)\n* If you were on a development branch, merge with main branch.\n* Use devtools::check()\n* Use devtools::check_win_devel() to test the package on Windows\n* Update cran-comments.\n  - If this is a resubmission, add a bulleted list of changes made under ## Resubmission.\n* Submit with devtools::release()\n* After the package is accepted, do this stuff: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#post-release\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2. Save as `NOTES`\n\n3. Add to gitignore.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git_ignore(\"NOTES\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4. Add to buildignore. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_build_ignore(\"NOTES\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Add license {#license} \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_mit_license()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe function will do all of this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](use_mit_license.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou will still need to open the new `LICENSE` file and change `COPYRIGHT HOLDER:` to \"Brad Cannell\". You can also look in the templates folder for more elaborate licenses. \n\n## Step 4: Modify the description file {#modify}\n\nOpen the description file and make some changes. \n\nHere is a minimal example from `codebook`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPackage: codebook\nTitle: Create Codebooks From Data Frames\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthors@R: person(\"Brad\", \"Cannell\", email = \"brad.cannell@gmail.com\",\n  role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\", \"cph\"))\nMaintainer: Brad Cannell <brad.cannell@gmail.com>\nDescription: The codebook package is intended to make it easy for users to \n  create codebooks (i.e. data dictionaries) directly from data frame.\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nEncoding: UTF-8\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.1.2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere is a slightly more elaborate example from `meantables`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPackage: meantables\nType: Package\nTitle: Make Quick Descriptive Tables for Continuous Variables\nDescription: Quickly make tables of descriptive statistics (i.e., counts, \n    means, confidence intervals) for continuous variables. This \n    package is designed to work in a Tidyverse pipeline, and consideration\n    has been given to get results from R to 'Microsoft Word' ¬Æ with minimal pain.\nVersion: 0.1.2\nAuthors@R: person(\"Brad\", \"Cannell\", email = \"brad.cannell@gmail.com\",\n  role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\", \"cph\"))\nMaintainer: Brad Cannell <brad.cannell@gmail.com>\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nEncoding: UTF-8\nSuggests: \n    knitr,\n    rmarkdown,\n    testthat\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\nRoxygenNote: 7.1.2\nImports: \n    dplyr,\n    tibble,\n    rlang,\n    stringr\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* Remember that Title Case is required for the Title\n\n* **Do Not** use `library(package)` in R scripts - instead add package dependencies to the `Imports` or `Remotes` field in the DESCRIPTION. **Do** use `library(package)` in vignette .Rmd files, and **DO NOT** add these package dependencies to the DESCRIPTION\n\n* If we already added R scripts to the package directory, we need to open them now and make sure to remove all the `library()` functions. \n\n* When adding CRAN packages to imports, you must first make sure they are installed.\n\n* <a href = \"https://github.com/hadley/devtools/blob/master/vignettes/dependencies.Rmd\" target = \"_blank\">Instructions for installing dependencies from sources other than CRAN are given here</a>.\n\n## Step 5: Add README {#readme}\n\nIn [R Packages, Chapter 2: The Whole Game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html), Hadley and Jenny basically create all the package code before connecting their project to their remote repository on GitHub. I actually like to connect my project to GitHub before I write any code. I do this for several reasons, one of which is that I can start using GitHub's issues and project boards right away to take notes and plan package development. \n\nAnd, I like to create the README file before I initialize Git or connect with GitHub. That's what we will do in this step. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_readme_rmd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* I generally just copy the Description section from the `DESCRIPTION` file and use it replace the \"The goal of codebook is to ...\" sentence that that `use_readme_rmd()` creates by default. \n\n* Comment out all of the code chunks that `use_readme_rmd()` creates by default.\n\n* Add installation instructions to README. Although we haven't created the repository yet, we know what it's going to be called.    \n\nThe README file already contains the following lines:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](install_placeholder.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe just need to replace it with:\n\n**Make sure to set the `eval=FALSE` code chunk option.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"brad-cannell/codebook\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* Just replace \"codebook\" in the path above with the name of the repository for the package project you are currently working on. \n\n* You can leave everything else as-is for now. \n\n**Render README**\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to render it to make README.md! The pre-commit hook should remind you if you try to commit README.Rmd, but not README.md, and also when README.md appears to be out-of-date.\n\nThe very best way to render README.Rmd is with build_readme(), because it takes care to render with the most current version of your package, i.e. it installs a temporary copy from the current source.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::build_readme()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Step 6: Add Git {#git}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* Go ahead and commit all the files in the directory so far, and agree to restart R. \n\n## Step 7: Connect to GitHub {#github}\n\n**Caution**\n\nSo far, using this method will add the repo to my personal account (mbcann01), not to my organization. You can either:\n\n* Create the repo manually on GitHub first, then follow GitHub's instructions for syncing.\n\n* After you create the repo on mbcann01, transfer ownership to brad-cannell in the Settings menu.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_github()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe function will do all of this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](use_github.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* Go ahead and agree to commit. \n\n### Setting up GitHub\n\nI added a page on the [templates package wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/templates/wiki/R-Package-Templates) about setting up the issue tags, planner project boards, etc. That seems more durable writing them here.\n\n## Step 8: Adding content to the package {#package-functions}\n\nAt this point, we have an (empty) working package, which can be downloaded from our GitHub repository. Now, we just need to add the functions, data, and documentation that will make it actually worth using. \n\n### Working with R scripts\n\n1. Don't write or alter your functions in the console as you would in a typical interactive session. If you do, it's easy for the version you're using interactively and the version you are actually including in your package to get out of sync. Instead, _load_ the package.\n\n2. Click the build tab > More > Load All, or `devtools::load_all`, or shift + cmd + L\n\n### Adding help pages to functions\n\nHelp pages are contained in .Rd files saved in the man folder. It's best practice to use `roxygen` with your script files to automatically generate the .Rd files. Doing so helps to keep your scripts and your help pages in sync.\n\nTo use roxygen:\n\n1. Make sure the R script you want to document is active.\n\n2. Click Project Options > Build Tools > Generate documentation with Roxygen\n\n3. Place your cursor in the function you want to document\n\n4. Insert a Roxygen skeleton with the keyboard shortcut cmd + alt + shift + R\n\n5. After you've filled in the skeleton click Build > More > Document, or use the keyboard shortcut shift + cmd + D. RStudio will then automatically generate the help pages in your man folder.\n\n6. Click the build tab > More > Load All, or `devtools::load_all`, or shift + cmd + L\n\n7. Check your help page by typing ?function_name in the console.\n\n### Example `roxygen` header\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#' @title Compact Table of Summary Statistics\n#'\n#' @description  Based on Stata's \"tabstat\" command. \"tabstat displays summary\n#'  statistics for a series of numeric variables in one table.

As explained in there, the code to create and/or clean the data will go in the `data-raw` directory and the data will eventually go in the `data/` directory. \n\nFor the `codebook` package, I wanted to simulate some really simple data that could be used for package examples. Here's how I did it.\n\nI started by running `usethis::use_data_raw(\"study\")`. Among other things, this creates the R script to be used to simulate the `study` data. Here is the header for the study data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# =============================================================================\n# Study data\n# This is the code to create the study data - a simulated data set that can be\n# used to demonstrate how to use the codebook package.\n# Created: 2022-04-04\n# Brad Cannell\n# =============================================================================\n\n# Insert simulation code here...\n\n\n# Add the simulated data to the data directory.\nusethis::use_data(study, overwrite = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Documenting data\n\n> Objects in data/ are always effectively exported (they use a slightly different mechanism than NAMESPACE but the details are not important). This means that they must be documented. Documenting data is like documenting a function with a few minor differences. Instead of documenting the data directly, you document the name of the dataset and save it in R/. @Wickham2022-ff\n\nFor example, the roxygen2 block used to document the `study` data in the `codebook` package is saved as R/data.R and looks something like this: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#' Simulated study data.\n#'\n#' This is the code to create the study data - a simulated data set that can be\n#' used to demonstrate how to use the codebook package.\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with 20 rows and 4 variables:\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{id}{participant id}\n#'   \\item{gender}{participant gender, female/male}\n#'   \\item{date}{date of enrollment}\n#'   \\item{height}{participant height, in inches}\n#' }\n\"study\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* \"`@format` gives an overview of the dataset. For data frames, you should include a definition list that describes each variable. It‚Äôs usually a good idea to describe variables‚Äô units here.\" @Wickham2022-ff\n\n* \"Never @export a data set.\" @Wickham2022-ff\n\n* The file is save as `R/data.R`. \n\n[Click here to view the documentation for ggplot's diamonds data](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data).\n\n### Documenting Package\n\nYou can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. As described in [section 10.6 of R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-packages), @Wickham2022-ff\n\n> You can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. This is accessed with `package?foo`, and can be used to describe the most important components of your package. It‚Äôs a useful supplement to vignettes, as described in the next chapter.\n\n> There‚Äôs no object that corresponds to a package, so you need to document NULL, and then manually label it with `@docType` package and `@name <package-name>`. This is also an excellent place to use the `@section tag` to divide up page into useful categories.\n\n>I usually put this documentation in a file called `<package-name>.R`. It‚Äôs also a good place to put the package level import statements that you‚Äôll learn about in imports.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#' foo: A package for computating the notorious bar statistic\n#'\n#' The foo package provides three categories of important functions:\n#' foo, bar and baz.\n#' \n#' @section Foo functions:\n#' The foo functions ...\n#'\n#' @docType package\n#' @name foo\nNULL\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Step 9: Creating unit tests {#testing}\n\nTesting is an important part of programming. For detailed information on testing see the appropriate [testing chapter in R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html). @Wickham2022-ff \n\nGet started with `devtools::use_testthat()`.\n\n1. Create test file. Must be in `tests/testhat`. File name should start with test_ and the function name. For example, `test_check_catvars`.   \n\n2. Modify your code or tests   \n\n3. Test your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T or `devtools::test()`.   \n\n4. Repeat until all tests pass.\n\n## Step 10: Vignettes {#vignettes}\n\nThere are some great vignette resources on the internet: \n\n* <a href = \"http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html\" target = \"_blank\">Chapter on vignettes in Hadley's Package book</a>   \n\n* <a href = \"ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/doc/contrib/Leisch-CreatingPackages.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">Leisch's creating R packages tutorial</a>   \n\n* <a href = \"http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/vignetteAnalysis.html\" target = \"_blank\">Flight's article on creating an analysis as a package and vignette</a>   \n\n### To create a vignette:   \n\n* run `usethis::use_vignette(\"my-vignette\")`\n\n* Open `vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd`\n\n* Create the vignette\n\n* Unlike R scripts, install and load packages directly in the vignettes.\n\n* Knit the vignette - The default action will be to create a version of the vignette that can be viewed in RStudio. However, `devtools::install_github()` (and friends) will not build vignettes by default because they‚Äôre time consuming and may require additional packages. So, in order to be able to view the vignette in RStudio, you must use vignettes = TRUE, e.g., devtools::install_github(\"brad-cannell/bfuncs\", build_vignettes = TRUE) instead.\n\n* Use `devtools::build_vignettes()` to create an html version of the vignette in `inst/doc` that you can provide a link to on your Github README page. By default, these folders will be added to .gitignore. Remove them from .gitignore to be able to view/use them on Github. Create a rawgit version of the html vignette file, and providea link to it on README.\n\n* use use `devtools::build()` to create a package bundle with the vignettes included. RStudio‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild & reload‚Äù does not build vignettes to save time.\n\n* When you add or update vignettes, push to Github again.\n\n### Vignette Notes:\n\nThis builds the vignettes, and is probably fine for a regular package of functions. However, when using packages as a means for reproducible, self-contained analysis projects, the vignettes have greater importance, and by default are not easily accessible.   \nNeed to find a way to make the vignettes more \"front and center\"   \n\n* Create a help page for the entire package that includes links to the vignettes?\n\n* Include links to the README.md file and upload to GitHub (with the data sets excluded)?\n\n* Remember to use `system.file()` when reading in data inside a code chunk. If you have trouble getting it to work, try build & reload.\n\n* To save a data frame to `data/` inside a vignette, you can use the <a href = \"https://github.com/krlmlr/rprojroot\" target = \"_blank\">rprojroot package</a>. use `rprojroot::find_root(\"DESCRIPTION\")`\n\n### Pkgdown\n\nI haven't tried the [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) package yet, but I think it is essentially a collection supercharged vignettes for your package. I'd like to try it soon.\n\n## Submitting to CRAN {#cran}\n\nYou can also do this stuff when you complete a \"version\" of the package even if you aren't submitting it to CRAN. \n\nUseful website: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html\n\n1. If the version number is set to a development version (e.g., .9000), change it to a number that meets the CRAN requirements (i.e., x.x.x)\n   - Make this change in `Description` and in `News.md`.\n\n2. Make sure you using the most updated code before checks. devtools::load_all() and devtools::install()\n\n3. Update README before submission. It should roughly match the examples in the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/other-markdown.html#sec-readme).\n   - Update `README.Rmd`, not `README.md`.   \n   - Knit `README.Rmd` after making changes. This will automatically update `README.md`   \n  \n4. Update documentation/vignettes using `devtools::document()`\n\n5. Update news.md. Here's dplyr's: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dplyr/master/NEWS.md\n\n   - Here's the news.md section from R Packages: https://r-pkgs.org/other-markdown.html#news\n  \n   - Remember to add news.md to buildignore. `usethis::use_build_ignore(\"news.md\")`\n  \n   - Here's a basic news.md from freqtables:\n  \n```\n# freqtables (development version)\n\n# freqtables 0.1.1\n\n* Add an informative error for user if they forget to pass a data frame to freq_table() (#29)\n\n# freqtables 0.1.0\n\n* First release on CRAN\n```\n\n6. If you were on a development branch, merge with main branch.\n\n7. Use `devtools::check()`\n\n8. Use `devtools::check_win_devel()` to test the package on Windows\n\n9. Use `devtools::check_rhub()`\n\n10. If you don't plan to submit to CRAN, this is probably a good time to use `devtools::install()` to re-build and install the package locally.\n\n11. Update `cran-comments`.   \n\n   - Remember to add news.md to buildignore `usethis::use_build_ignore(\"cran-comments.md\")` if you haven't already.\n \n   - If this is a resubmission, add a bulleted list of changes made under ## Resubmission.\n \n   - Here is a link to the cran-comments section of R Packages: https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#sec-release-process\n \n   - Here's a basic cran-comments.md from freqtables:\n \n```\n## Test environments\n* local OS X install, R 4.1.3\n* Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC\n* win-builder (devel and release)\n\n## R CMD check results\nThere were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs\n\n## Downstream dependencies\nThere are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.\n```\n\n13. Submit with `devtools::release()`\n\nAfter the package is accepted, do this stuff: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#post-release\n\n* If you use GitHub, go to the repository release page. Create a new release with tag version v1.2.3 (i.e. ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by the version of your package). Copy and paste the contents of the relevant NEWS.md section into the release notes.\n\n* Add the .9000 suffix to the Version field in the DESCRIPTION to indicate that this is a development version. Create a new heading in NEWS.md and commit the changes.\n\n## Package evolution\n\nHere are some good pages on maintaining and evolving packages over time.\n\n* [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review. Chapter 15: Package evolution - changing stuff in your package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/evolution.html#evolution)\n\n* [The lifecycle package](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/)\n\n## Other random notes\n\n### Get rid of .DS_Store\n\nThe `.DS_Store` file can be an annoyance when working with Git on MacOS. [Here is a link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository/107921) to instructions for removing `.DS_Store` from your repository. Do it early and never worry about it again. \n\nIn the terminal, run the following code from the root directory:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Remove existing files from the repository:\nfind . -name \"*.DS_Store\" -type f -exec git-rm {} \\;\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Add .DS_Store to .gitignore\necho .DS_Store >> .gitignore\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# Commit the file to the repo\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit -m '.DS_Store banished!'\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### File mode changes\n\nWhen working on Epi III -- and I think this could be an issue with using git on OneDrive more generally -- I would have to recommit files when I changed computers. Not because the **content** of the file had changed, but because something called the **file mode** had changed. I searched SO and seemed to fix it with this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580596/how-do-i-make-git-ignore-file-mode-chmod-changes\n\nOpen terminal and type:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit config core.fileMode false\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Icon files\n\nAnother issue I encountered when working on Epi III -- and I think this could be an issue with using git on OneDrive more generally -- was the existence of these \"Icon\" files every time I switched computers. However, they didn't seem to actually exist (or at least they weren't visible), and ignoring them in the usual way did not seem to _actually_ ignore them. I searched SO and seemed to fix it with this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17556250/how-to-ignore-icon-in-git\n\nOpen terminal and type:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nprintf \"Icon\\r\\r\" >> .gitignore\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Errors, warnings, notes\n\nBelow are some common errors, warnings and notes I've encountered during build tests.\n\n> W  checking for unstated dependencies in examples ...\n   'library' or 'require' call not declared from: ‚Äòtidyverse‚Äô\nE  checking examples (707ms)\n   Running examples in ‚Äòfreqtables-Ex.R‚Äô failed\n   The error most likely occurred in:\n   \nI got this error because I had `library(tidyverse)` in the @examples section of my roxygen2 header in one of my R scripts, but I did not have `tidyverse` in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file. I could add `tidyverse` to the DESCRIPTION file (`usethis::use_package(\"tidyverse\", type = \"Imports\")`). However, in this case I chose to use `library(dplyr)`, which was already in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file, instead.\n\n>\nW  checking dependencies in R code (369ms)\n   '::' or ':::' import not declared from: ‚Äòrlang‚Äô\n\nTo fix this one simply run the following code in the console: `usethis::use_package(\"rlang\", type = \"Imports\")`\n\n> Warning: ‚Äòinst/doc‚Äô files ... ignored as vignettes have been rebuilt.\n\nJust ignore this one.\n\n> Warning in strptime(xx, f <- \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\", tz = tz) : unknown timezone 'zone/tz/2017c.1.0/zoneinfo/America/Chicago'\n\nJust ingnore this one. It's a problem with my computer, not with the package code.\n\n> Non-standard files/directories found at top level: ‚Äòdevelop_test_table.Rmd‚Äô ‚Äòdevelop_test_table.nb.html‚Äô\n\nNeed to delete these files when I'm done developing chi-square test.\n\n> Prevents R CMD check: \"no visible binding for global variable ‚Äò.‚Äô\"\n\nPut the following (for example) directly inside the function definition in the R script where the function is defined:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Prevents R CMD check: \"no visible binding for global variable ‚Äò.‚Äô\"\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------\nn = n_total = prop = t_crit = se = lcl_wald = ucl_wald = percent = NULL\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n> N  checking R code for possible problems (1.8s)\n   get_group_n: no visible global function definition for ‚Äò%>%‚Äô\n   Undefined global functions or variables:\n     %>%\n     \n[Info on fixing this issue](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html#imports)\n\nShort answer: Add the following directly inside the roxygen2 header in the R script where the function is defined: `@importFrom dplyr %>%`. You must also make sure that it gets to the NAMESPACE. Run `usethis::use_namespace()` and then `devtools::document()` to get it into NAMESPACE.\n\n> Non-standard file/directory found at top level: 'meantables_hex'\n  \nI got this error after submitting meantables to CRAN. The problem is with the hex sticker file in the meantable hex sticker I added for the README. This SO issue gives some advice: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44113759/note-or-warning-from-package-check-when-readme-md-includes-images\n\nI moved the stickers to `man/figures`. It seems to have solved the problem.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
